Intro to Inferential Statistics
===============================

Lesson 1: Introduction and Lesson 7 (Intro to Descriptive Statistics) Review
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
An approximate answer to the right problem is worth a good deal more than an exact 
	answer to an approximate problem.

What is Inferential Statistics?
a. Finding approximate answers
b. Make predictions about data
c. Run tests to find the accuracy of the model

Course Overview (Descriptive Statistics):
a. Research methods and visualizing data
b. Describing data
c. Normal Distribution

Course Overview (Inferential Statistics):
a. Estimation and Hypothesis testing
b. t-tests and ANOVA
c. Relationships between two variables

Central Limit Theorem:
a. Mean of sampling distribution = Mean of population distribution
b. Relationship of standard deviation of sampling distribution (SE) and standard
	deviation of population (σ) is given by SE = σ / sqrt(sample size)

Central Limit Theorem helps in determining the probability of randomly selecting
	a sample with mean at least x.
