Intro to Descriptive Statistics

Lesson 1: Intro to Research Methods
-----------------------------------
Descriptive Statistics allows to summarize data and shape how to make decisions.

It involves gathering, organizing, computing, and visualizing information from 
	the dataset.

A good sample size, a representative sample, and a sound methodology are important
	to conduct a valid research.

Describe your problem statement explicitly (Define Constructs).

A construct is an idea or theory containing various conceptual elements, typically 
	one considered to be subjective and not based on empirical evidence.

Operational definition makes measuring constructs in real world possible.

Data consists of samples (rows) and variables (columns).

In order to perform research correctly, make everything constant while measuring 
	one variable. These are called extraneous factors.

Average score of entire population in an experiment: Population Parameter (𝝁)
Average score of sample in an experiment: Sample Statistic (x̅)

We can predict population parameter using sample statistics, given a good sample.

𝝁 - x̅ = Sampling Error

Bigger the sample, more the sample statistic will be closer to population parameter.

Another way is to draw multiple random samples which will give interval in which
	population parameter lies.

Plotting samples on a graph:
Variable on x axis is independent variable.
Variable on y axis is dependent variable.

Correlation does not prove causation.

Show correlation => Observational studies surveys
Show causation => Controlled experiment

Controlled experiment uses blinding techniques to avoid biases.
Use random assignment.
